## About

This repository aims to demonstrate my skills with PHP through simple projects with this language.

These are some of the projects when I started programming in PHP before I even went to college. Therefore, they are not such robust projects lol.

Here you can find projects with **`Pure PHP`**, **`OOP with PHP`**, project in PHP with **`Communication with the Database (CRUD)`** among others.
